`idf-build-apps` is a tool that helps users find and build [ESP-IDF][esp-idf], and [ESP8266 RTOS][esp8266-rtos] projects in a large scale.

## What is an `app`?

A project using [ESP-IDF][esp-idf] SDK, or [ESP8266 RTOS][esp8266-rtos] SDK typically contains:

- Build recipe in CMake or Make and the main component with app sources
- (Optional) One or more [sdkconfig][sdkconfig] files

`app` is the abbreviation for application. An application is a set of binary files that is being built with the specified [sdkconfig][sdkconfig] and the target chip. `idf-build-apps` could build one project into a number of applications according to the matrix of these two parameters.

## Installation

```shell
pip install idf-build-apps
```

or `pipx`

```shell
pipx install idf-build-apps
```

## Basic Usage

`idf-build-apps` is a python package that could be used as a library or a CLI tool.

As a CLI tool, it contains two sub-commands.

- `find` to find the buildable applications
- `build` to build the found applications

For detailed explanation to all CLI options, you may run

```shell
idf-build-apps -h
idf-build-apps find -h
idf-build-apps build -h
```

As a library, you may check the [API documentation][api-doc] for more information. Overall it provides

- Two functions, `find_apps` and `build_apps`
- Two classes, `CMakeApp` and `MakeApp`

## Quick CLI Example

To build [ESP-IDF hello world example project][hello-world] with ESP32:

```shell
idf-build-apps build -p $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world/ --target esp32
```

The binary files will be generated under `$IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world/build` directory.
